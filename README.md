Reflection

The industry talks have motivated me to realise practical experience, flexibility, and continued education are important elements of my professional and personal growth. I realised how important it is to take benefit of chances to gain hands-on experience and to remain changing to modern technologies to develop a successful computer science career.

By learning different topics in computer science, I aim to increase my skills, find my interests, and go deeper into areas that bring me success and achievement. The talk emphasised the importance of integrating personal goals, interests, and abilities to create a well-planned road to future success.
